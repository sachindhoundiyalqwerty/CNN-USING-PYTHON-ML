# CNN-USING-PYTHON-ML
This Python project uses a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify an uploaded image of an animal. It identifies the animal and provides a concise description. The script is run from the command line, offering a straightforward solution for image recognition.
Animal Photo Classifier
This project is a Python application that uses a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify an image of an animal and provide a brief description. The model used is MobileNetV2, which is an efficient and powerful model for image recognition.

Files
main.py: The main script containing the logic for image classification.

README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.

Requirements
To run this script, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

tensorflow

Pillow (PIL Fork)

numpy

You can install these dependencies using pip:

pip install tensorflow Pillow numpy

How to Run
Place an image file of an animal (e.g., my_animal_photo.jpg) in the same directory as the main.py script.

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

Run the script using the following command:

python main.py

When prompted, enter the name of your image file. The script will then output the classification result and a description of the animal.
